# Aligning Embedding Spaces Across Languages to Identify Word-Level Equivalents

Data, scrapers, and model architecture for the LING111 Final Project. In this project, we developed an English-Chinese encoder-decoder model using 12 million Chinese and 6.5 million English embeddings from the Tencent AI lab and applied it to English-Chinese translation pairs scraped from online dictionaries in order to test its performance and accuracy. Our aim was to train a model that could automatically identify good translation pairs between English and Chinese, e.g. "dog" and "ç‹—".
